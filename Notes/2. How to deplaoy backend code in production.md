# ✅ Topic: How to Deploy Backend Code in Production

## 🎯 Objective of this Lecture

- Build a complete backend application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**.
- **Deploy it to production** (real-world environment).
- Understand **how production deployment works** and **remove the fear** of deployment.
- Learn **strategies and best practices** for deployment.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Node.js** (Runtime for backend JavaScript)
- **Express** (Web framework for Node.js)
- **Mongoose** (ODM library for MongoDB)

---

## 🌐 Client-Server Model Overview

```
Computer / Mobile
     |  Sends Request  (HTTP)
     v
   [ Server ]
     |  Responds (HTTP)
     v
Computer / Mobile
```

### 📌 In Our Server:

- **Express** will handle request and response.
- **Mongoose** will help us interact with the database (MongoDB).

---

## 🚦 Basic Concept of Server

- A **server is always running** and **listening** for incoming requests.
- When a user visits a URL or makes a request:
  - The server receives the request.
  - Based on the **route** and **request type**, it sends the appropriate response.

---

## 🛣️ Understanding Routes

### Common Routes:

| Route       | Description          |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `/`         | Home Route           |
| `/login`    | Login functionality  |
| `/search`   | Search functionality |
| `/register` | Register new user    |

Routes define the **endpoints** that the server listens to.

---

## 📦 What is Express?

- A **Node.js package**.
- Used to **create servers**, define **routes**, and handle **HTTP methods**.
- Handles request and response cycle efficiently.

---

## 📥 Types of Requests (HTTP Methods)

| Type     | Purpose                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | Fetch data from server                  |
| `POST`   | Send data to server (e.g., create user) |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data                    |
| `DELETE` | Remove data                             |
| `PATCH`  | Partially update data                   |

### 🧪 Example: Using GET Request

- A client (browser/Postman) sends a **GET** request to `/`.
- Server responds with `"Hello World"` or some data.

# 📁 Setting Up a Basic Node.js App – *chai aur deploy*

## ✅ Step 1: Open Folder in VS Code

* Open the folder named `chai aur deploy` in Visual Studio Code.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Initialize an Empty Node.js Application

### Why?

To begin any Node.js project, we need a `package.json` file. It keeps track of project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and more.

### Open the terminal inside VS Code and run:

#### 🔹 Option 1: `npm init`

```bash
npm init
```

* This command starts a step-by-step interactive process.
* It asks for project details (name, version, description, entry point, author, license, etc.).
* Based on your answers, it creates a `package.json` file.
* Example interaction:

```
package name: (chai-aur-deploy) chaibackend
version: (1.0.0)
description: a basic app to deploy
entry point: (index.js)
...
Is this OK? (yes)
```

#### 🔹 Option 2: `npm init -y`

```bash
npm init -y
```

* Instantly creates a `package.json` with default values.
* No questions are asked — it uses sensible defaults for everything.

### 🤔 What is `init`?

* `init` is an **npm utility** that sets up a new Node.js project.
* It walks you through creating a `package.json` file.
* Afterward, use:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

* To install packages and add them to the `dependencies` in `package.json`.

---

## 📄 Example: package.json created

```json
{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": ["node", "chai"],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

---

## 📝 Step 3: Create `index.js` File

* This is the entry point of your application.
* Create a new file named `index.js` in the root folder.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Add Script Command to Run App

Modify `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

### ▶️ To run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

> This runs `node index.js` behind the scenes.

💡 Why use `scripts`?

* Useful when running servers or specific tools repeatedly.
* Clean and reusable commands.

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Install Express.js

### What is Express?

* **Express.js** is a lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js.
* Helps you build web servers and APIs easily.

### To install:

```bash
npm install express
```

✅ This adds `express` to the `dependencies` section in `package.json`.

---

## 🌐 Step 6: Create a Simple Express Server

Paste the following code into `index.js`:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

### Explanation:

* `express()` initializes the app.
* `app.get('/', ...)` defines a route for HTTP GET requests.
* `app.listen(...)` starts the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## ✅ Summary of Commands

| Task                             | Command               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Initialize project (interactive) | `npm init`            |
| Initialize project (defaults)    | `npm init -y`         |
| Install Express.js               | `npm install express` |
| Run your Node app                | `npm run start`       |

# Understanding Ports in Computer Systems

In computer systems, **"ports"** can refer to different things depending on the context. Here's a breakdown of the most common meanings:

---

### 1. **Hardware Ports (Physical)**

These are physical connection points on your computer where you plug in external devices.

#### Common types:

* **USB port** – for keyboards, mice, flash drives, etc.
* **HDMI port** – for connecting displays.
* **Ethernet port** – for wired internet connections.
* **Audio port** – for headphones and microphones.
* **VGA/DisplayPort** – for monitors.

---

### 2. **Software Ports (Networking/Communication Ports)**

These are **virtual ports** used by computer programs and services to communicate over a network (like the internet or LAN).

#### Key points:

* Ports range from **0 to 65535**.
* Used with **IP addresses** to direct data to the correct application.
* Managed by the **Transport Layer** (mostly TCP or UDP).

#### Common port numbers:

| Port  | Protocol | Use                         |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 20/21 | FTP      | File Transfer Protocol      |
| 22    | SSH      | Secure Shell (remote login) |
| 23    | Telnet   | Remote login (not secure)   |
| 25    | SMTP     | Sending email               |
| 53    | DNS      | Domain Name System          |
| 80    | HTTP     | Web traffic (unsecured)     |
| 443   | HTTPS    | Web traffic (secured)       |
| 3306  | MySQL    | Database                    |

---

### 3. **Ports in Programming / Compilers**

When talking about compilers or systems programming:

* **Porting** software means **adapting code** to run on a different platform or operating system.

  * E.g., Porting a Windows program to run on Linux.
* This is different from **network ports** or **hardware ports**.

---

### Summary Table:

| Type         | Description                                   | Example             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Hardware     | Physical interface for external devices       | USB, HDMI, Ethernet |
| Network Port | Logical endpoint for communication            | Port 80 for HTTP    |
| Porting Code | Modifying software to run on another platform | Windows → Linux     |

# Express.js Beginner Code Explanation

This document explains the following Express.js code in detail:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

---

## 📦 1. `const express = require('express')`

- You're **importing the Express module**.
- `require('express')` loads the Express library.
- `express` is a **function** that returns an Express application object when called.
- You store it in a variable called `express`.

🧠 Think of Express like a toolset to **create servers** easily in Node.js.

---

## 🚀 2. `const app = express()`

- You're **calling the express function** to create an `app`.
- `app` now represents your **Express application/server**.
- This object has methods like `.get()`, `.post()`, `.listen()` to **handle web requests**.

---

## 🔢 3. `const port = 3000`

- You've set a variable `port` to `3000`.
- This means your server will **run on port 3000**.
- Example: If you go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, you’ll hit your server.

---

## 🛣️ 4. `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })`

- This sets up a **route**.
- `app.get()` handles **GET requests** (like when a user visits a webpage).
- `'/'` means the root URL (homepage).
- `(req, res)` is a **callback function** with two arguments:
  - `req` → the request object (contains info from the client/browser).
  - `res` → the response object (you use it to **send something back** to the user).

```js
res.send('Hello World!')
```

- This line sends **"Hello World!"** as a response to the browser when someone visits `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🟢 5. `app.listen(port, () => { ... })`

- This tells your app to **start listening for requests** on port `3000`.
- When it starts successfully, it runs the callback:
```js
console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
```
- This just logs a message to the terminal so you know your server is running.

---

## 💡 Full Flow:

1. You run the script using: `node filename.js`
2. Server starts on `http://localhost:3000`
3. When someone visits that URL, it matches the `'/'` route.
4. Server responds with **"Hello World!"**
5. You see that in the browser.

---

## 📌 Summary:

| Line | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `require('express')` | Imports Express |
| `express()` | Creates an app |
| `app.get()` | Sets up route for GET requests |
| `res.send()` | Sends a response to the client |
| `app.listen()` | Starts the server on a port |

# ✅ Backend Notes: CommonJS vs ES Modules, dotenv, JSON, and Deployment

## ✅ 1. Difference Between CommonJS and ES Modules

| Feature               | CommonJS (CJS)                   | ES Modules (ESM)                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax                | `require()` and `module.exports` | `import` and `export`                              |
| File Extension        | `.js` (default in Node)          | `.mjs` or use `"type": "module"` in `package.json` |
| Load Style            | Synchronous                      | Asynchronous                                       |
| Default in Node.js    | Yes (prior to v12)               | Supported natively in Node v12+                    |
| Browser Compatibility | Not supported without bundlers   | Supported in modern browsers                       |

### ✏️ Example: CommonJS

```js
// math.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
module.exports = { add };

// index.js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(2, 3));
```

### ✏️ Example: ES Module

```js
// math.mjs
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// index.mjs
import { add } from './math.mjs';
console.log(add(2, 3));
```

---

## ✅ 2. Environment Variables with `.env` and `dotenv`

### 🔒 Why use `.env`?

In production, we don’t want to expose sensitive data like:

* Database Username/Password
* Login URLs
* Secret API Keys
* Port Numbers

### 🛠 Steps to use `.env` in Node.js:

#### 1. **Install dotenv**

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

#### 2. **Create a `.env` file**

```env
PORT=4000
DB_USERNAME=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypass
```

#### 3. **Update your `index.js` or main file**

```js
require('dotenv').config(); // Add this line at the top

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
});
```

> ⚠️ Use `process.env.PORT` (not `process.env.port` — it's case-sensitive)

#### ✅ Advantages of `.env`

* Keeps sensitive info private
* Easy to switch between environments (dev, staging, prod)
* Avoids hardcoding

---

## ✅ 3. Sending JSON Data in Express

### 🧾 Express middleware to handle JSON:

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

### 🧪 Sample API to handle JSON:

```js
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body;
  console.log(data); // Logs the JSON data received
  res.json({ message: "JSON data received", data });
});
```

> Without `express.json()`, `req.body` will be `undefined`.

---

## ✅ 4. Deploying a Node.js Backend App on DigitalOcean (Using Application Deployment)

### 🔧 Methods to Deploy:

* **Manually via Droplets (VPS)**
* **Using DigitalOcean App Platform (PaaS - like Render/Heroku)** ✅ Easier

---

### 💡 Using DigitalOcean **App Platform** (Recommended for beginners)

#### 🔗 Prerequisites

* GitHub account with your backend project pushed
* DigitalOcean account

---

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Deployment on DigitalOcean App Platform:

1. **Push your backend project to GitHub**

2. **Login to [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com)**

3. Go to: **Apps → Create App**

4. **Connect your GitHub repo**

5. Select the backend repository and branch

6. Set up **Build & Run Environment**

   * Choose **Node.js**
   * Set build command: `npm install`
   * Set run command: `node index.js` or `npm start`

7. **Set Environment Variables**

   * Go to "Environment Variables"
   * Add variables like:

     ```
     PORT=4000
     DB_USERNAME=yourUser
     DB_PASSWORD=yourPassword
     ```

8. **Set HTTP Port**

   * Auto-detected from your `.env`, or set manually

9. Click **Deploy**

10. Your app will get a **live URL like**:

```
https://your-app-name.ondigitalocean.app
```

How to deplaoy backend code in production

In this lecture, 
- we will make an application
- then deplaoy it in the production

It will remove fear from our mind that how thing goes in production.

We will also discuss strategies of deployment.

Requirement:
- NodeJS


Computer/  | ---------  | Server
Mobile     | <---------  | 
            Express + 
                mongoose

- Request/Response is handled by Express
- Mongoose is related to database


- Computer/ mobile sends request.
- Server responds to the request. We will build server.


When you visit any URL. A server is listening. The server responds to the client. The server decides which response to send.

Something should be there which constantly listening. 

postman.com is also called home route. /: home route
Likewise, we have lots of routes of each application. 
/login: login setup
/search:

The listening is done by Express.
Express is a package.

Types of request:
- GET request
- // complete here

We are sending a GET request.
We will handle get request.


---


Open "chai aur deploy" folder in vs code

Now, we need to make an empty node application so that we can install express and other.

How to make empty node application?
Open terminal:
npm init   => // explain 
or
npm init -y => // explain


init is a utility => this utility will walk you through creating a package.json file. it only covers the most common items, and it tries to guess sensible defaults.
npm install <pkg> afterwards to install a package and save it as a dependency inn the package.json file.

vite is also utility

prabhansh-tiwari@prabhanshtiwari:~/Desktop/chai aur deploy$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.




Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (chai-aur-deploy) chaibackend
version: (1.0.0) 
description: a basic app to deploy
entry point: (index.js) 
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: node chai 
author: prabhansh tiwari
license: (ISC) 
About to write to /home/prabhansh-tiwari/Desktop/chai aur deploy/package.json:

{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "chai"
  ],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes) 


- After this a package.json file is created.

package.json

{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "chai"
  ],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}




Create  a file called index.js

How to run this file using package.json

Now, we make script command:

"start":"node index.js"


npm run start
- only the above comand is run using this.

these scripts help when we are working with servers

EXPRESS is used to create backend


To install express:
- npm install express

You can see in dependencies section that express has been installed.


Now, visit express website:
Copy the code :
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})

Paste it in index.js

---

Difference between common JS and module js?


Now, we have created the application.
We, will deploy it now

When we deploy production grade application,
we need to take care of few things.
Especially, we need to take care of some variables which convey sensitive information like database username, password, login url etc.
These are sensitive issues that should not be directly available


It is not guaranted that the given port 4000 is free. The port 4000 may be busy.

We need to read about .env package
We need to install it.

npm i dotenv

Now, we need to make another file called .env
PORT = 4000

How to use this?

require('dotenv').config()
- Put this line in the index.js 

Change this line to:

app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${process.env.port}`)
})


Now,, to deploy in production, we need to see where do we want to deplay it. (AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean)

Digital Ocean
Heroku
railway
seenode
render
cyclic.sh

Demo is on Digital Ocean
// make note on how to deploy our backend app on digital ocean USING APPLICATION


Note: We can also send json data, using req.json()

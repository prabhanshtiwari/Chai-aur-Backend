# ✅ Topic: How to Deploy Backend Code in Production

## 🎯 Objective of this Lecture

- Build a complete backend application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**.
- **Deploy it to production** (real-world environment).
- Understand **how production deployment works** and **remove the fear** of deployment.
- Learn **strategies and best practices** for deployment.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- **Node.js** (Runtime for backend JavaScript)
- **Express** (Web framework for Node.js)
- **Mongoose** (ODM library for MongoDB)

---

## 🌐 Client-Server Model Overview

```
Computer / Mobile
     |  Sends Request  (HTTP)
     v
   [ Server ]
     |  Responds (HTTP)
     v
Computer / Mobile
```

### 📌 In Our Server:

- **Express** will handle request and response.
- **Mongoose** will help us interact with the database (MongoDB).

---

## 🚦 Basic Concept of Server

- A **server is always running** and **listening** for incoming requests.
- When a user visits a URL or makes a request:
  - The server receives the request.
  - Based on the **route** and **request type**, it sends the appropriate response.

---

## 🛣️ Understanding Routes

### Common Routes:

| Route       | Description          |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `/`         | Home Route           |
| `/login`    | Login functionality  |
| `/search`   | Search functionality |
| `/register` | Register new user    |

Routes define the **endpoints** that the server listens to.

---

## 📦 What is Express?

- A **Node.js package**.
- Used to **create servers**, define **routes**, and handle **HTTP methods**.
- Handles request and response cycle efficiently.

---

## 📥 Types of Requests (HTTP Methods)

| Type     | Purpose                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | Fetch data from server                  |
| `POST`   | Send data to server (e.g., create user) |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data                    |
| `DELETE` | Remove data                             |
| `PATCH`  | Partially update data                   |

### 🧪 Example: Using GET Request

- A client (browser/Postman) sends a **GET** request to `/`.
- Server responds with `"Hello World"` or some data.

# 📁 Setting Up a Basic Node.js App – *chai aur deploy*

## ✅ Step 1: Open Folder in VS Code

* Open the folder named `chai aur deploy` in Visual Studio Code.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Initialize an Empty Node.js Application

### Why?

To begin any Node.js project, we need a `package.json` file. It keeps track of project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and more.

### Open the terminal inside VS Code and run:

#### 🔹 Option 1: `npm init`

```bash
npm init
```

* This command starts a step-by-step interactive process.
* It asks for project details (name, version, description, entry point, author, license, etc.).
* Based on your answers, it creates a `package.json` file.
* Example interaction:

```
package name: (chai-aur-deploy) chaibackend
version: (1.0.0)
description: a basic app to deploy
entry point: (index.js)
...
Is this OK? (yes)
```

#### 🔹 Option 2: `npm init -y`

```bash
npm init -y
```

* Instantly creates a `package.json` with default values.
* No questions are asked — it uses sensible defaults for everything.

### 🤔 What is `init`?

* `init` is an **npm utility** that sets up a new Node.js project.
* It walks you through creating a `package.json` file.
* Afterward, use:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

* To install packages and add them to the `dependencies` in `package.json`.

---

## 📄 Example: package.json created

```json
{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": ["node", "chai"],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

---

## 📝 Step 3: Create `index.js` File

* This is the entry point of your application.
* Create a new file named `index.js` in the root folder.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Add Script Command to Run App

Modify `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

### ▶️ To run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

> This runs `node index.js` behind the scenes.

💡 Why use `scripts`?

* Useful when running servers or specific tools repeatedly.
* Clean and reusable commands.

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Install Express.js

### What is Express?

* **Express.js** is a lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js.
* Helps you build web servers and APIs easily.

### To install:

```bash
npm install express
```

✅ This adds `express` to the `dependencies` section in `package.json`.

---

## 🌐 Step 6: Create a Simple Express Server

Paste the following code into `index.js`:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

### Explanation:

* `express()` initializes the app.
* `app.get('/', ...)` defines a route for HTTP GET requests.
* `app.listen(...)` starts the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

# Understanding Ports in Computer Systems

In computer systems, **"ports"** can refer to different things depending on the context. Here's a breakdown of the most common meanings:

---

### 1. **Hardware Ports (Physical)**

These are physical connection points on your computer where you plug in external devices.

#### Common types:

* **USB port** – for keyboards, mice, flash drives, etc.
* **HDMI port** – for connecting displays.
* **Ethernet port** – for wired internet connections.
* **Audio port** – for headphones and microphones.
* **VGA/DisplayPort** – for monitors.

---

### 2. **Software Ports (Networking/Communication Ports)**

These are **virtual ports** used by computer programs and services to communicate over a network (like the internet or LAN).

#### Key points:

* Ports range from **0 to 65535**.
* Used with **IP addresses** to direct data to the correct application.
* Managed by the **Transport Layer** (mostly TCP or UDP).

#### Common port numbers:

| Port  | Protocol | Use                         |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 20/21 | FTP      | File Transfer Protocol      |
| 22    | SSH      | Secure Shell (remote login) |
| 23    | Telnet   | Remote login (not secure)   |
| 25    | SMTP     | Sending email               |
| 53    | DNS      | Domain Name System          |
| 80    | HTTP     | Web traffic (unsecured)     |
| 443   | HTTPS    | Web traffic (secured)       |
| 3306  | MySQL    | Database                    |

---

### 3. **Ports in Programming / Compilers**

When talking about compilers or systems programming:

* **Porting** software means **adapting code** to run on a different platform or operating system.

  * E.g., Porting a Windows program to run on Linux.
* This is different from **network ports** or **hardware ports**.

---

### Summary Table:

| Type         | Description                                   | Example             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Hardware     | Physical interface for external devices       | USB, HDMI, Ethernet |
| Network Port | Logical endpoint for communication            | Port 80 for HTTP    |
| Porting Code | Modifying software to run on another platform | Windows → Linux     |

How to deplaoy backend code in production

In this lecture, 
- we will make an application
- then deplaoy it in the production

It will remove fear from our mind that how thing goes in production.

We will also discuss strategies of deployment.

Requirement:
- NodeJS


Computer/  | --------->  | Server
Mobile     | <---------  | 
            Express + 
                mongoose

- Request/Response is handled by Express
- Mongoose is related to database


- Computer/ mobile sends request.
- Server responds to the request. We will build server.


When you visit any URL. A server is listening. The server responds to the client. The server decides which response to send.

Something should be there which constantly listening. 

postman.com is also called home route. /: home route
Likewise, we have lots of routes of each application. 
/login: login setup
/search:

The listening is done by Express.
Express is a package.

Types of request:
- GET request
- // complete here

We are sending a GET request.
We will handle get request.

Open "chai aur deploy" folder in vs code

Now, we need to make an empty node application so that we can install express and other.

How to make empty node application?
Open terminal:
npm init   => // explain 
or
npm init -y => // explain


init is a utility => this utility will walk you through creating a package.json file. it only covers the most common items, and it tries to guess sensible defaults.
npm install <pkg> afterwards to install a package and save it as a dependency inn the package.json file.

vite is also utility

prabhansh-tiwari@prabhanshtiwari:~/Desktop/chai aur deploy$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.




Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (chai-aur-deploy) chaibackend
version: (1.0.0) 
description: a basic app to deploy
entry point: (index.js) 
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: node chai 
author: prabhansh tiwari
license: (ISC) 
About to write to /home/prabhansh-tiwari/Desktop/chai aur deploy/package.json:

{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "chai"
  ],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes) 


- After this a package.json file is created.

package.json

{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "chai"
  ],
  "author": "prabhansh tiwari",
  "license": "ISC"
}




Create  a file called index.js

How to run this file using package.json

Now, we make script command:

"start":"node index.js"


npm run start
- only the above comand is run using this.

these scripts help when we are working with servers

EXPRESS is used to create backend


To install express:
- npm install express

You can see in dependencies section that express has been installed.


Now, visit express website:
Copy the code :
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})

Paste it in index.js

Data modelling for backend with mongoose

Questions to ask before building backend:
- What data points(user email, password, photo etc) are needed to be stored?

In this lecture,
- we will get clarity of how the data fields are defined
- we will learn how backend is built from scratch
- what data to store and how?



We will use a tool called mongoose.
- moon modeler :
    - used for data modelliing
    - it works exactly like mongoose

- eraser io:
    - used for data modelliing
    - 


What is data modelling?
- defining the structure of data 
- database diagram


Use pen and paper and try to make a screen first. What data fields are needed?


Which screen should we make first: login or register?
- always give preference to those screens where the data is collected and saved

Login - refers to data validation
Register - // fill here
